# lucasarts-protection-sheets
A couple of programs to generate the copy protection tables for some LucasArts adventure games.

I made these for myself by descumming the game scripts. My second-hand copies of _Loom_ and _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade_ didn't include the manual, and the versions of _Maniac Mansion_ and _Zak McKracken_ sold digitally doesn't include the copy protection sheets.
