# lucasarts-protection-sheets
A couple of programs to generate the copy protection codes/tables for some LucasArts adventure games.

This project is in no way affiliated with the ScummVM project. I made these for myself by descumming the game scripts because my second-hand copies of _Loom_ and _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade_ didn't include the manual. (I do have printed copies of the of the _Maniac Mansion_ and _Zak McKracken_ sheets, but the ones sold digitally doesn't include them so this seemed like a nice way of preserving them.)
